- You need to set the umask value to 022  & it should be permanent
    -> Try to see the files & folder created after checking the umask

Ans : sudo gedit ~/.bashrc
      Add umask 022 to the document, save it and then logout and login
      

-> Again change the umask value to the default value

Ans : sudo gedit ~/.bashrc
      Add umask 022 to the document and save it and logout and login
      Remove umask 022 to the document, save it and then logout and login

	su root
	
	touch lock.txt

	chmod go-r lock.txt
	
	su maulik
	
	touch access.txt
	
	chmod g+rw access.txt

Create a directory on the desktop with the name as CapgeminiFolder
    - make sure the members of the group i.e "BigDataEmplyee" should be able to access the data inside the drectory
    - and other users can't access it
	
Answer :
 	-> $ mkdir CapgeminiFolder
	$ sudo groupadd BigDataEmployee
	$ sudo usermod -aG BigDataEmployee newUser
	$ sudo usermod -aG BigDataEmployee capg -> This is the manager
	$ sudo chgrp BigDataEmployee CapgeminiFolder
	$ chmod -R o-rwx CapgeminiFolder
	$ chmod -R g+rwx CapgeminiFolder 

    - Make sure one thing one user can't access or write the file of other user present in the above shared directory
    - But make sure, the user {manager} he should be able to access all the data & can remove the files
